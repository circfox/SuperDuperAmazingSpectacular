We are building a web app that utilized the Walmart and YouTube APIs to provide shoppers with a seamless product research experience.

We are targeting any and all potential buyers

Our goal is to create a web app that will display all of the necessary information a potential buyer would need to make an educated decision on a product they are looking to purchase
